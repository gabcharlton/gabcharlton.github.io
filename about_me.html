        <h2>Where I Came From</h2>
        <p>   I started coding 14 years ago, with my very first website as part of my high school computer class. 
        Since then, during my schooling and through self-directed projects, I've learned a plethora of languages, such as: Python, SQL, R, HTML, CSS, C++, and JavaScript. <br>
           When I first immigrated to Canada 6 years ago, I never imagined that I would be pursuing a career as a data scientist. 
        I obtained my <b>BSc. in Physics with a minor in Earth Science</b> in 2019 at Memorial University of Newfoundland. 
        I've always had a strong desire to learn about the world and science, and when I found that opportunity at MUN, I couldn't pass it up. 
        There, I learned how to conduct advanced mathematical techniques both in theory (e.g., advanced Calculus, Linear Algebra, Quantum Physics, etc.)
        and practically (Seismic Potential Methods using Python/ Numpy + Pandas as an example).<br> 
           Once gradauted, I worked 5.5 years as a bookkeeper for a start up.
        During my work, I studied independently, obtaining multiple certifications for Data Science and coding skills and applications via Coursera and Udemy. 
        I also started studying for my <b>MSc. in Data Science at the University of Colorado Boulder</b> virtually.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Where I am Now</h2>
        <p>Currently I work as a CEA at TD and this position is helping me gain some hands on experience for what people face everyday with thier banking and financial needs.
        With my background as a bookkeeper and seeing financial needs for businesses, now I am learning what everyday people would like from their banking and finances. 
        I am aiming to work in fintech, so I know that these two experiences will help me be the best data professional for a team as I can understand what the business itself would
        like to know more about, along with the customer and what they may would like form tehir everday experience. </p>
        
        <h2>Where I'm Going</h2>
        <p>I'm currently looking for a data analyst role in the financial industry. With my experience in a booking SaaS company and as a Customer Experience Associate at a bank,
        I kow that I would be a asset on any data team in fintech. I am a team player, open to feedback and always looking at ways to improve myself.</p>
