        <p>
          The dataset I will be using holds data regarding best-selling books based on title, published year genre, and sales number. The main columns of this dataset I will use include:<br>

* Book <br>
* Author(s) <br>
* Original language <br>
* First published <br>
* Approximate sales in millions <br>
* Genre <br>
For this exercise, I'm imagining that I am at a point in my life when I am considering a drastic career change. A career I've always wanted was to open a bookstore. In preparation for opening my own book store, I am having a hard time finding classics for my books inventory. The main goal for me is to know what books are most guaranteed for sales and success. I would like to know: <br>

What kinds of books are the most popular?<br>

What genre typically sells the most?<br>
Which author typically has sold the most ?<br>
What original language is the most popular for books sold?<br>
What are the trends with popular book sales over the years?<br>

What has been the most popular genre over the years?<br>
Who has been the most popular author over the years?<br>
What has been the most popular original language over the years?<br>
