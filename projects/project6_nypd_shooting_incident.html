        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          In this project I analyzed a police incident dataset based in New York, USA, and communicated my findings. The goal with this analysis will give a comprehensive view of where a person will be safe if they were to move to New York City. The three main questions I asked were: <br>
          1.What areas are the safest? <br>
          2. What segment of the population of New York City is most vulnerable to gun violence? <br>
          3. What time of day and year are most likely correlated with increased gun violence? <br>
          This analysis would be very useful for those who are interested in moving or exploring new areas, but may be intimated due to being a minority and/or not knowing the area.
