              <h3>Netflix Canada Movies Analysis</h3>
              <p> This project was a simple data analysis where I worked through a Netflix Movies and TV dataset on Kaggle. My main goal was to gain insights into the viewing patterns of movies in Canada, and to practice using the Altair package. </p>

              <h3>Best Selling Books - Fundamentals of Data Visualization Final Project</h3>
              <p>In this project, I analyzed a dataset of books and communicated my findings for a person opening a bookstore, who wants to know what books to stock for inventory. I would like to know: 1. What kinds of books are the most popular? 2. What are the trends in popular book sales over the years? The results from this analysis would be useful for small business owners who would like to be assured that the inventory they stock will have the best chance of success.</p>

              <h3>NYPD Shooting Incident - Data Analysis Project</h3>
              <p>In this project I analyzed a police incident dataset based in New York, USA, and communicated my findings. The goal with this analysis will give a comprehensive view of where a person will be safe if they were to move to New York City. The three main questions I asked were:1.What areas are the safest? 2. What segment of the population of New York City is most vulnerable to gun violence? 3. What time of day and year are most likely correlated with increased gun violence? This analysis would be very useful for those who are interested in moving or exploring new areas, but may be intimated due to being a minority and/or not knowing the area.</p>
